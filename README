The instructions for setting up this build environment are almost identical to 
the ones already documented on the gumstix wiki:
    http://www.gumstix.net/Software/cat/Software-verdex-pro/111.html

Since the top level directory name is different you will need to make sure that
the proper path is set in your .bashrc.

'bitbake gumstix-pip-image` and you are off to the races!

Note: I have tried to keep most of the changes local to user.collection. You
may search through the commit history at:
    http://github.com/jdegges/gumstix-pip-oe/commits/master
to see exactly what was altered in org.openembedded.snapshot and
com.gumstix.collection.
