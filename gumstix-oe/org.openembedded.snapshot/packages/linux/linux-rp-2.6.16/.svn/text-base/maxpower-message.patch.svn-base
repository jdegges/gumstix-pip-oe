Subject: [PATCH] USB: print message when device is rejected due to insufficient power
X-Git-Tag: v2.6.18-rc1
X-Git-Url: http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=1fbe75e12f0dd567c86533e13ba2605f3ecad2e1

[PATCH] USB: print message when device is rejected due to insufficient power

2.6.16 introduces USB power budgeting in the Linux kernel, and since then, a
fair number of users have observed that some of their devices no longer work in
unpowered hubs (this is not a bug, the devices claim that they need more than
100mA).

The very least we can do is print an informational message to the kernel log
when this happens, otherwise it is not at all clear why the device was not
accepted.
