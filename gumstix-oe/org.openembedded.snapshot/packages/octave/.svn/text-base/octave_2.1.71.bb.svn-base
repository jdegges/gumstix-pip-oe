DESCRIPTION = "GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. \
It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, \
and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. \
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language."
